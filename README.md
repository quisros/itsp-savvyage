# ITSP2020_SAVVYage

SAVVYage is a socially aware autonomous bot made by my team for ITSP 2020. 

This repo contains all the files made to comeup with a bot which uses odometry and sensors to localize itself and mapp it's surroundings and move around in the environment planning it's own path, with the addition of gmapping.
